                  Yes, each prebuilt website is 100% customizable. All prebuilt
                  websites are professionally designed by our in-house design
                  team, created to showcase Avadaâ€™s capabilities and save you
                  time. Once you import a prebuilt website, you can entirely
                  customize the content and layouts to your liking. You can add
                  your own imagery, change text, change colors or completely
                  change any of the layouts using the Avada Website Builder.
